This site is trying to evolve the idea of a __multi-app page (MAP)__.

It conveys the opinionated view of the author(s). As a work in progress it can undergo changes at any time. The changes are reflected transparently by the backing GitHub repository [alaarmann/multi-app-page](https://github.com/alaarmann/multi-app-page/).

## Vision

A user accessing a multi-app page (MAP) has the option to add one or more applications of her choice to the page and control their access to the page's data.

For the user these applications add value to the web page in so far as they are able to interact with the page. The user has full transparency over the extent of interaction.

## Example

## Implementation

### Trust


## Bigger Picture

Cross-application interaction in the frontend is up to this date only poorly supported.
