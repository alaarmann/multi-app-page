This is a work in progress trying to evolve the idea of a __multi-app page (MAP)__.

## The Vision

A user accessing a MAP has the option to add one or more applications of her choice to the page and control their access to the page's data. For the user these applications add value to the web page in so far as they are able to interact with the page. The user has full transparency over the extent of interaction.
