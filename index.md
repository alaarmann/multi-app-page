This site is trying to evolve the idea of a __multi-app page (MAP)__.

It conveys the opinionated view of the author(s). As a work in progress it can undergo changes at any time. The changes are reflected transparently by the backing GitHub repository [alaarmann/multi-app-page](https://github.com/alaarmann/multi-app-page/).

## Vision

A user accessing a multi-app page (MAP) has the option to add one or more applications of her choice to the page and control their access to the page's data.

For the user these applications add value to the web page in so far as they are able to interact with the page. The user has full transparency over the extent of interaction.

## Example

## Implementation
### Isolation
### Interaction
### Trust

TLS-secured URL


## Bigger Picture

Environment: Operating System
Up to now cross-application interaction in the frontend is only poorly supported. The common way to exchange data between user-facing applications is to _copy_ it to the 'clipboard' and _paste_ it in the destination. Type of data, mismatch, poor integration of apps.

New: environment browser
 Runtime environment for always 'heavier' frontend applications, rise of SPA, advent of WebAssembly.
 Semantic markup, microformats make it possible to exchange 'typed' information with semantic value.

Never trust the server: shift the linking between systems to the frontend. Give the user more control over inter-connections between systems.
